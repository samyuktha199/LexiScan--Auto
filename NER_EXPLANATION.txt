Named Entity Recognition (NER) Module – LexiScan-Auto

This module extracts structured legal entities from contracts.

Dataset:
The CUAD (Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset) was used because it contains
real-world legal contracts with annotated clauses.

Model:
spaCy NER was trained to detect legal entities such as:
- DATE
- PARTY
- MONEY
- TERMINATION

Training:
Annotated text-label pairs were generated from CUAD and used to train a
custom spaCy NER model.

Post-processing:
Rule-based validation was applied after model prediction:
- Dates validated using regex
- Monetary values checked for currency or numbers
- Party names validated for non-empty text
- Termination clauses extracted at sentence level

Output:
The final output is generated in structured JSON format, making it suitable
for downstream APIs and frontend consumption.

Limitations:
Party name extraction depends on sentence structure and may miss complex cases.
TRANSFER LEARNING DETAILS

This project uses transfer learning through SpaCy’s pre-trained English NLP pipeline.
Instead of training a model from scratch, an existing SpaCy language model was fine-tuned
using the CUAD (Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset), which contains real-world legal contracts.

Fine-tuning allows the model to retain general language understanding while adapting to
legal-domain entities such as DATE, PARTY, MONEY, and TERMINATION.
This approach improves contextual understanding and accuracy with limited labeled data.
